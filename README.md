<b> How to remove Wid (tested on Windows XP, update maybe needed)</b>

!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!



After closed the ransomware window, the MBR is overwrited and cannot be used.

Firstly, insert your Windows Vista CD, then open <b>Automatic Repair.</b>

Restart your computer and insert Windows Live CD including BootICE (e.g. 50MB Win7 CD), start BootICE and write WEE MBR (loader menu list file is included on BootICE)

Restart your PC and select <b>Windows</b>.

If you accessed Windows normally, delete these files;

C:\WINDOWS\a.exe  - Main window file

C:\WINDOWS\system32\Boot.exe   - MBR overwriting app


Now, your Wid ransomware is removed.
